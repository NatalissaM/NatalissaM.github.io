        <p>I guess this is just going to be me rambling and trying out some coding I guess.
        </p>
        <p>I've never written a blog before and tbh I have no idea what I'm doing. I hope no-one will ever read this.<br>
        Also I'm sorry about my english, it's not my first language and I still struggle with grammar.
